# deai

**deai** is a tool to automate your Linux desktop. It has similar goals as [hammerspoon](https://github.com/Hammerspoon/hammerspoon). But it aims to be more extensible and support for more language.

Desktop automation has a different scale on Linux desktops, because Linux has a much diverse desktop eco-system. Desktop Environments (DE) on Linux is generally a group of well orchestrated components. **deai** can bring the same level of orchestration outside of a DE. It can potentially provides users the level of convenience and user experience like a DE, while gives the user much more freedom and configurability.

This README (and this project) is under construction. Check again later.

## The name

**deai** comes from Japanese: 出会い, which means "to meet with", or "encounter". Desktop automation is a "meeting" of different components, hence the name.
